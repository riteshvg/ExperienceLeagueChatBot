Issue/Symptoms
Scheduled or downloaded PDF contains truncated rows as below example.
Resolution
resolution
On the
truncated Freeform table
, click the
Return to default height
icon, save the project, and reschedule or download the Workspace Project again.
Cause
It is very similar to a collapsed panel, and when downloading a collapsed PDF, it will not expand the panel.
For the same reason, we need to expand the truncated Freeform table by clicking the
Return to default height
icon. It is working as designed.
