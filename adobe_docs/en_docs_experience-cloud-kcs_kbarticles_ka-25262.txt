Contains
operators cause segments to work incorrectly.

Issue/Symptoms
The
Contains
related operators are the most processing-intensive features in segmentation, as these analyze the entire content of every value. Using hundreds of
Contains
operators in segments prevent the segments from working correctly.

Resolution

If you have many segment conditions (for example, Page equals X, Page equals Y, or Page equals Z repeated with hundreds of different values), follow the workaround below:
Create segments separately for one hundred different values per segment.
Use classifications to group dimension items. Instead of writing out hundreds of conditions, classify all desired values into a classified value, then use the classified value in a segment.
Also, refer to
Segmentation best practices
for details.
