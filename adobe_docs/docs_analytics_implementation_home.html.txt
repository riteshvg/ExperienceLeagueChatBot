Adobe Analytics requires code within your website, mobile app, or other application to send data to data collection servers. There are several methods to implement this code, depending on platform and your organization’s needs.
Website implementation methods
For your
website
, the following implementation methods are available:
Client-side
Web SDK extension
: The standardized and recommended method to implement Adobe Analytics for new customers. Add the
Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension
in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection
Tags
, then place a loader tag on each page. The tag sends data to the Adobe Experience Platform
Edge Network
, which forwards that data to Adobe Analytics.
See
How to implement Adobe Analytics using the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension.
for more information.
Web SDK
: You can manually load the Web SDK libraries on your site if you do not want to use Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection. Reference the Web SDK library (
alloy.js
) on each page, and send the desired tracking calls to the Adobe Experience Platform
Edge Network
in a format convenient to your organization. The Edge Network forwards that data to Adobe Analytics.
See
How to implement Adobe Analytics using the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK
for more information.
Analytics extension
: Add the
Adobe Analytics extension
in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection
Tags
, then place a loader tag on each page. The tag sends data directly to Adobe Analytics. Use this implementation method if you want the convenience of Tags, but do not want to use the Edge Network infrastructure.
See
How to implement Adobe Analytics using the Analytics extension
for more information.
Legacy JavaScript
: The historical manual method to implement Adobe Analytics. Reference the AppMeasurement library (
AppMeasurement.js
) on each page, then set variables and settings in JavaScript.
This implementation method can be useful for implementations using custom code and is ideal for implementation types not offered elsewhere, such as for
AMP pages
.
The following decision flow can help you select a client-side implementation method:
TIP
Contact your Adobe Account Team for advice and best practices on which implementation to choose based on your current situation.
Server-side
To implement Adobe Analytics server side, you have the following options:
Edge Network API
: You implement code on the server that uses the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network API to communicate with Adobe Analytics through a datastream.
See
Implement Adobe Analytics using the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network API
for more information.
(Bulk) Data Insertion API
: You use the Adobe Analytics (Bulk) Data Insertion API’s to collect data server-side directly into Adobe Analytics.
See
Data Insertion API
for more information.
Mobile app implementation methods
For your
mobile app
, the following implementation methods are available:
Mobile SDK extension
: The standardized and recommended method to implement Adobe Analytics in your mobile app. Use dedicated libraries to easily send data to Adobe from within your mobile app. Add the
Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK extension
in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection
Tags
, then implement the Mobile SDK library in your app. You can use the SDK to import libraries, register extensions, and load the tag configuration. Send data to the Adobe Experience Platform
Edge Network
; Edge then forwards that data to Adobe Analytics.
See
Implement Adobe Analytics using the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK
for more information.
Analytics extension
: Add the
Adobe Analytics extension
in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection
Tags
, and implement the Mobile SDK library in your app. You can use the SDK to import libraries, register extensions, and load the tag configuration. This implementation method sends data directly to Adobe Analytics. It is recommended if you want the convenience of Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection, but do not want to use Adobe’s Experience Platform Edge network infrastructure.

for more information.
CAUTION
See for support for older versions of Adobe’s mobile SDKs the
SDKs end-of-support announcements
