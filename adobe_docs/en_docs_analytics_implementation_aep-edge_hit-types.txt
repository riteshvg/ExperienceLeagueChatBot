Adobe Analytics treats hits differently depending on what functions you call in AppMeasurement. For example,
s.t
and
s.tl
include or omit certain dimensions and increment page views differently. Adobe Experience Platform only contains the
sendEvent
command. Specific properties within the
xdm
payload determine how that data is interpreted in Adobe Analytics.
The Edge Network uses the following logic to determine Adobe Analytics page views and link events:
XDM payload contains…
Adobe Analytics…
xdm.web.webPageDetails.name
or
xdm.web.webPageDetails.URL
and no
xdm.web.webInteraction.type
considers payload a
page view
xdm.eventType = web.webPageDetails.pageViews
considers payload a
page view
xdm.web.webInteraction.type
and (
xdm.web.webInteraction.name
or
xdm.web.webInteraction.url
)
considers payload a
link event
xdm.web.webInteraction.type
and (
xdm.web.webPageDetails.name
or
xdm.web.webPageDetails.url
)
considers payload a
link event
Also sets
xdm.web.webPageDetails.name
and
xdm.web.webPageDetails.URL
to
null
no
xdm.web.webInteraction.type
and (no
xdm.webPageDetails.name
and no
xdm.web.webPageDetails.URL
)
drops the payload and ignores the data
In addition to differentiating page views and link clicks, the following logic is in place that determines if certain events are categorized as A4T or are discarded.
XDM payload contains…
Adobe Analytics…
xdm.eventType = display
or
xdm.eventType = decisioning.propositionDisplay
or
xdm.eventType = personalization.request
or
xdm.eventType = decisioning.propositionFetch
and
xdm._experience.decisioning
considers payload an
A4T
call.
xdm.eventType = display
or
xdm.eventType = decisioning.propositionDisplay
or
xdm.eventType = personalization.request
or
xdm.eventType = decisioning.propositionFetch
and no
xdm._experience.decisioning
drops the payload and ignores the data
xdm.eventType = click
or
xdm.eventType = decisioning.propositionInteract
and
xdm._experience.decisioning
and no
web.webInteraction.type
considers payload an
A4T
call.
xdm.eventType = click
or
xdm.eventType = decisioning.propositionInteract
and no
xdm._experience.decisioning
and no
web.webInteraction.type
drops the payload and ignores the data.
