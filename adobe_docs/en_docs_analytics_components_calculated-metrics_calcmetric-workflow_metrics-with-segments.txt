In the
Calculated metric builder
, you can apply segments within your metric definition. Applying segments is helpful if you want to use metrics for a subset of your data in your analysis.
NOTE
Segment definitions are updated through the
Segment builder
. If you make a change to a segment, the segment is automatically updated everywhere it is used, including if the segment is part of a calculated metric definition.
You want to compare metrics for German people interacting with your brand versus people outside of Germany. So, you can answer questions like:
How many German versus international people are visiting your most
popular pages
.
How many German versus international people in
total
have interacted online with your brand this month.
What are the
percentages
of Germans and international people that have visited your popular pages?
See the sections below to illustrate how segmented metrics can help you answer these questions. Where appropriate, references are made to more detailed documentation.
Popular pages
Create a calculated metric
from a Workspace project, named
Germany
.
From within the
Calculated metric builder
,
create a segment
, titled
Germany
, that is using the Countries field.
