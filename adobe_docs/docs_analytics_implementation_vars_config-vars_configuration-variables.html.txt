Configuration variables control the way data is captured and processed in reporting. They do not typically contain dimension or metric values.
Setting configuration variables
In implementations using the Web SDK extension or Analytics extension, configuration variables are typically found in the extensionâ€™s settings:
Log in to
Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection
using your AdobeID credentials.
Click the desired tag property.
Click the Extensions tab, then Click Configure under the extension.
In JavaScript implementations using
AppMeasurement.js
, configuration variables are typically set at the top of the JS file.
IMPORTANT
Make sure that all configuration variables are set before calling a tracking method (
t()
or
tl()
). Avoid setting configuration variables in the
doPlugins()
function.
