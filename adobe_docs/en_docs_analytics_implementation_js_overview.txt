CREATED FOR:
Developer
AppMeasurement for JavaScript has historically been a common method to implement Adobe Analytics. However, with increasing popularity of Tag Management Systems, using
tags in Adobe Experience Platform
is recommended.
A high-level overview of the implementation tasks:
Task
More Information
1
Ensure you have
defined a report suite
Report Suite Manager
2
Download the required JavaScript code for AppMeasurement
from Code Manager. Unzip the file.
Code Manager
3
Add
AppMeasurement.js
to your website's template file
. The code contains the libraries required to send data to Adobe.
code language-html
<head>
  <script src="AppMeasurement.js"></script>
  â€¦
</head>
4
Define configuration variables within
AppMeasurement.js
. When the Analytics object is instantiated, these variables make sure that data collection settings are correct.
code language-javascript
// Instantiate the Analytics tracking object with report suite ID
var s_account = "examplersid";
var s=s_gi(s_account);

// Make sure data is sent to the correct tracking server
s.trackingServer = "example.data.adobedc.net";
Configuration Variables
5
Define page-level variables within your site's page code
. These variables determine specific dimension and metrics sent to Adobe.
code language-js
s.pageName = "Example page";
s.eVar1 = "Example eVar";
s.events = "event1";
Page Variables
6
Send the data to Adobe using the
t()
method
, when all page variables are defined.
code language-js
s.t();
t() method
7
Extend and validate your implementation
before pushing it out to production.
