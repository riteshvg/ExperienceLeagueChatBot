Livestream TNT Fields with algorithms
Livestream is undergoing a refresh to ensure the technology continues to be modern and stable. As part of that refresh, if your TNT field has an algorithm in it, we will begin incorporating the TNT field into Livestream output. However, this includes only the previously supported elements:
campaignId
,
recipeId
,
trafficType
,
actionId
, and
actionName
. The overall TNT schema for Livestream remains unchanged.

Description
Legacy Report Builder
June 18, 2025
The legacy Report Builder add-in will be retired in June 2026. All users should begin upgrading their legacy workbooks to the
new Report Builder
. The new Report Builder is available to both Adobe and Customer Journey Analytics customers. It has
near feature parity
plus many new convenient features and UI enhancements. To facilitate the upgrade process, the new Report Builder includes an easy workbook conversion feature. The new Report Builder is only available as an add-in through the Microsoft Store. Many organizations require an internal approval process before the add-in can be made available to users. Please allow time for this process and begin working with your organization now to ensure enough time to upgrade your workbooks prior to the EOL date.
Access via legacy domains or via legacy SSO

January 2, 2026
. After this date, legacy login credentials and legacy SSO will no longer work. All users will be required to log in via

Adobe Customer Care
.
