This report is too complex. Please review best practices for building Analysis Workspace reports.
Your reporting request is too large and cannot be executed. Contributors to this error are timeouts due to the request’s complexity.
Simplify your request. For example, shorten the date range, or simplify the segment criteria, or remove some columns or rows in your table. You might also consider splitting the table into separate requests.

Troubleshooting
When using Analysis Workspae, you can use the information below to troubleshoot some common issues.
Issue
How to troubleshoot
When I drag a metric over, it says
Invalid data
.
Invalid data means that Adobe cannot return data using the combination of dimensions and metrics used in the report. For example, two metrics stacked on top of each other cannot be returned as data, as there is no way to display two metrics that way. Instead, place the metrics side by side.
When I drag a metric over, I don’t see any actual data - just zeros.
If you successfully created a workspace report but there’s no data, there are a few things you can check:
If you applied a segment in your report, the segment criteria might not match any data. Try removing the segment or adjusting the segment definition.
Check the date range in the upper right corner and make sure it’s set to a value that you expect.
Navigate to your website and use the
Debugger
to validate that data is being collected.
