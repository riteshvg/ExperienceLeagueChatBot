Analytics shared audience keeps showing “Collecting data” on Audience Library
Last update: Wed Jun 18 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
This article addresses the Adobe Analytics issue when using
未指定
(Unspecified) as the value of the segment condition, Analytics
shared audience
keeps showing
Collecting data
in the Audience Library. It is recommended to ensure use
evar1 exists
to return all the hits that have data collected.
Description

Environment

Issue/Symptoms
When data is not collected for a custom variable (Ex, eVar1), the value will be shown as “未指定” in the Analysis Workspace freeform table. If a segment uses this value to exclude all the hits that don’t have data and is published to Experience Cloud Audience, the audience size will be shown as
Collecting Data
instead of the size shown in the segment definition.
Resolution
resolution
For the value shown in the freeform table,
未指定
means no data was collected in the hits. Hence,
evar1 = 未指定
cannot return any hits on the backend.
Please use
evar1 exists
to return all the hits that have data collected.
