The
campaign
variable is dedicated to collecting tracking codes on your site. In previous versions of Adobe Analytics, it had special treatment where it could be used as a breakdown to most dimensions. In the current version of Adobe Analytics, it acts identical to an eVar.
This variable populates the
Tracking Code
dimension. It typically gets its value from a query string using the
getQueryParam
utility method. However, your organization determines exactly how to set this variable.
Campaign using the Web SDK
Campaign is mapped to the following variables:
XDM object
:
marketing.trackingCode
Data object
:
data.__adobe.analytics.campaign
or
data.__adobe.analytics.v0
Campaign using the Adobe Analytics extension
You can set campaign either while configuring the Analytics extension (global variables) or under rules.
Log in to
Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection
using your AdobeID credentials.
Click the desired tag property.
Go to the Rules tab, then click the desired rule (or create a rule).
Under Actions, click an existing Adobe Analytics - Set Variables action or click the ‘+’ icon.
Set the Extension drop-down list to Adobe Analytics, and the Action Type to Set Variables.
Locate the Campaign section.
You can set campaign to a value or a query string parameter.
s.campaign in AppMeasurement and the Analytics extension custom code editor
The
s.campaign
variable is a string that typically contains a tracking code used in marketing efforts. Its max length is 255 bytes; values longer than 255 bytes are automatically truncated when sent to Adobe.
// Set the campaign variable to a static value
s.campaign = "abc123";

// Collect the cid query string parameter value from the URL
// https://example.com?cid=abc123
s.campaign = s.Util.getQueryParam("cid");
