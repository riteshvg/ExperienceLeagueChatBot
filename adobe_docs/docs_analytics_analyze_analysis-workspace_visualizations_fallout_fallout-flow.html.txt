Fallout visualizations let you
Perform side-by-side comparisons of two different segments in the same report.
Drag, drop, and rearrange funnel steps (touchpoints)
Mix and match values from different dimensions and metrics
Create a multi-dimensional fallout report
Identify where customers go immediately after falling out
Fallout displays conversion and fallout rates between each step or touchpoint in a sequence.
For example, you can track a visitorâ€™s fallout points during a purchase process. Just select a beginning touchpoint and a conclusion touchpoint, and add intermediate touchpoints to create a website navigation path. But you can also do multi-dimensional fallouts.
A fallout visualization is useful for analyzing:
Conversion rates through specific processes on your site (such as a purchase or registration process).
General, wider-scope traffic flows: Of the people who saw the home page, this flow shows how many went on to perform a search, and then how many of them eventually went on to look at a specific item.
Correlations between events on your site. Correlations show what percentage of people who looked at your privacy policy went on to purchase a product.
