Documentation on how to automatically build Freeform Tables from a blank state. Previously, you could not drop components directly into a blank project or blank panel; you had to add a freeform table first. You can now drop components directly into a blank project or panel, and a freeform table will automatically be built for you in a recommended format. Additionally, improvements were made to how mixed component types (e.g. dimensions & metrics) are handled when dropped into a blank Freeform Table together.

New documentation on
Freeform Table Builder
. With Table Builder enabled, you can drag and drop in many dimensions, breakdowns, metrics and segments to build tables that answer more complex business questions. Data will not update immediately. Instead, updates occur after you click
Build
, saving you time once you know what table you want to construct. Additionally, this feature offers:
Preview
: You can preview the format of a table before spending time to render real data.
Flexible Row and breakdown settings
: You can set your row and breakdown levels for every dimension row. Previously, Workspace imposed defaults that could not be changed until after the data was returned.
Breakdown by position
: You can set dimension rows to always
breakdown by position
instead of
by specific item
(the default).
Manual static row ordering
: You can manually order static rows so that the table rows are displayed exactly as you need them. Previously, static rows could be sorted only by a metric column or alphabetically.

Apply a segment inclusion and return metrics separately.
Show churn instead of retention.
Show latency tables (time elapsed before and after an inclusion event).
Customize cohort dimension (to group visitors based on an eVar, not just time).
Do a rolling cohort calculation: calculate retention/churn based on prior time period, not original cohort.
Add in multiple metrics in inclusion & return fields, as well as apply segments. (Calculated metrics are not supported)
