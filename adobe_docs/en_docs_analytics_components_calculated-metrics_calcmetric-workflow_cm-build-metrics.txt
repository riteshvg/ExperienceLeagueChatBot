Adobe Analytics provides a canvas to drag and drop dimensions, metrics, segments, and functions to create custom metrics based on container hierarchy logic, rules, and operators. This integrated development tool lets you build and save simple or complex calculated metrics.
You can use the calculated metric builder to create or edit calculated metrics. When created in this way, calculated metrics are available in the component list and can then be used in projects throughout your organization. Alternatively, you can quickly create a calculated metric that is available only for the project where it was created, as described in
Create calculated metrics for a single project
in
Metrics
.
Create a calculated metric
describes the different options available to create a new calculated metric.
Areas of the calculated metrics builder
The
Calculated metric builder
dialog is used to create new or edit existing calculated metrics. The dialog is titled
New calculated metric
or
Edit calculated metric
for metrics that you create or manage from the
Calculated metrics manager
.
Calculated metric builder
Create or Edit calculated metric
Specify the following details (
is required):
table 0-row-2 1-row-2 2-row-2 3-row-2 4-row-2 5-row-2 6-row-2 7-row-2 8-row-2 9-row-2 10-row-2 11-row-2 12-row-2
Element
Description
Report suite
You can select the report suite for the calculated metric. The calculated metric you define is available in Workspace projects based on the selected report suite.
Project-only metric
An info box appears at the top of this dialog when you edit a calculated metric that was created for a single project, as described in
Create calculated metrics for a single project
.
If you want to make this calculated metric available for all projects, select the option,
Make this metric available to all your projects and add it to your component list
.
Title
Name the calculated metric, for example,
Conversion Rate
.
Description
Provide a description for the segment, for example,
Calculated metric to define the conversion rate.
There is no need to describe the formula for the calculated metric as the formula is already automatically available in Summary.
Format
Select a format for the calculated metric: You can select between
Decimal
,
Time
,
Percent
, and
Currency
.
Decimal places
Specify the number of decimal places for the format selected. Only enabled when the format selected is Decimal, Currency, and Percent.
Show upward trend as
Specify whether an upward trend of the calculated metric displays as ▲
Good (Green)
or as ▼
Bad (Red)
.
Currency
Specify the currency of the calculated metric. Only enabled when format selected is Currency.
Tags
Organize the calculated metric by creating or applying one or more tags. Start typing to find existing tags you can select. Or press
ENTER
to add a new tag. Select
to remove a tag.
Preview
The preview covers the last 90 days and is a way to gauge whether you have defined your metric correctly.
Summary
Displays a summary of the definition of the calculated metric.
For example:
Total Orders
Sessions
.
Definition
Define your segment using the
Definition builder
.
To verify whether your calculated metric definition is correct, use the constantly updated
Preview
of the results of the calculated metric. The
Preview
covers the last 90 days and evaluates the definition of your calculated metric continuously.
The
Product compatibility
indicates the compatibility of the calculated metric with Adobe Analytics functionalities. See
Metric compatibility
for more information.
Select:
Save
to save the calculated metric.
Save As
to save a copy of the calculated metric.
Cancel
to cancel any changes you made to the calculated metric or cancel the creation of a new calculated metric.
Definition builder
You use the Definition builder to drag and drop dimensions, metrics, segments, and functions to create custom metrics based on container hierarchy logic, rules, and operators. In that construction, you can use standard metrics, Adobe defined metrics, calculated metrics, segments, dimensions and functions. All these components are available from the component panel in the Calculated metric builder. Furthermore, you can use operators and containers in the definition.
Only metrics are defined as singular components in the
Definition
area. All other components are defined as a container, wrapping metrics or other containers. See
Containers
for more information.
Metrics
To add a metric:
Drag and drop an
Metrics
component from the components panel onto
Drag and drop metrics, dimensions, dimension items, segments, and/or functions here
. You can use the
in the components bar to search for specific components.
When you use a calculated metric as part of your definition, the calculated metric is expanded.
To modify a metric:
Select
in a metric component in the
Definition
area.
In the popup dialog you can define the type of metric and an attribution model. See
Metric type and Attribution
.
To delete a metric:
Select
in the metric.
Operators
Operators let you specify the operator between components or containers. Operators appear automatically between
two or more metrics in a container,
two or more containers in a container,
one or more metrics and one or more containers in a container.
You can select:
Symbol
Operator
Divide (default)
Multiply
Subtract
Add
Static number
You can add a static number to your calculated metric definition. To add a static number:
Select
Add
from within a container.
Select
Static number
. A static number container appears.
Select
Click to add a value
and type a value.
Containers
You add dimensions, segments and functions as containers to a calculated metric definition. You can also add a generic container. Containers function like a math expression and determine the order of operations. Anything within a container gets processed before the next component or container.
Segment container
You use the concept of a segment container to create a
segmented metric
. You can construct a segment container using a segment, or using a segment you create from a dimension.
To add a segment container from a dimension:
Drag and drop a
Dimensions
component from the components panel onto
Drag and drop metrics, dimensions, dimension items, segments, and/or functions here
. You can use the
in the components bar to search for specific components.
In the
Create Segment from Dimension
popup, define the condition for the segment. Select from the list of operators and select a value or enter a value. For example,
Month
equals
Sep 2024
.
Select
Done
. A segment container is added to the
Definition
.
To add a segment container from a segment, you can use:
Drag and drop a
Segments
component from the components panel onto
Drag and drop metrics, dimensions, dimension items, segments, and/or functions here
. You can use the
in the components bar to search for specific segments.
Automatically a segment container is added to the
Definition
, using the name of the segment.
Drag and drop a
Segment
component from the components panel onto a generic container. The container is modified into a segment container.
Select
Add
from within a container:
Select
Segment
. A segment container is added to the
Definition
.
In the new segment container, select a segment from the
Select…
drop-down menu.
note tip
TIP
You can add more than one segment to a container.
The segments in the container are named after the segment component. For example,
Web sessions
. Select
to display a popup with details on the segment. In the popup, select
to edit the segment definition.
To remove a segment from a container:
Select
next to the segment name.
See
Segmented metrics
for more details and examples.
Function container
To add a function container, you can use:
Drag and drop:
Drag and drop a
Functions
component from the components panel onto
Drag and drop metrics, dimensions, dimension items, segments, and/or functions here
. You can use the
in the components bar to search for specific functions.
Automatically a function container is added to the
Definition
using the name of the function.
Select
Add
from within a container:
Select
Function
.
In the container, select a function from the
Select…
drop-down menu.
The function container is named after the function component. For example,
SQUARE ROOT (metric)
. Select
to display a popup with details on the function. Select
Learn more
for more information on the function.
See
Use functions
for details on how to use functions and what functions are available to create a calculated metric.
Generic container
To add a generic container:
Select
Add
from within a container
Select
Container
. A new empty generic container is added to the
Definition
. You can use a generic container to nest or create a hierarchy in the definition of your calculated metric.
Delete a container
To delete a container, select
at the container level.
