The
t()
method is an important core component to Adobe Analytics. It takes all Analytics variables defined on the page, compiles them into an image request, and sends that data to Adobe data collection servers.
For example, consider the following JavaScript code:
// Instantiate the tracking object
var s = s_gi("examplersid");

// Define config variables and page variables
s.trackingServerSecure = "data.example.com";
s.eVar1 = "Example dimension item";

// Compile the variables on the page into an image request to Adobe
s.t();
Running the
t()
method takes all Analytics variables defined and formulates a URL based on those variables. Some Analytics variables determine the URL of the image, while other variables determine query string parameter values.
https://data.example.com/b/ss/examplersid/1/?v1=Example%20dimension%20item
Adobe receives the image request, then parses the request header, URL, and query string parameters. Data collection servers then return a transparent 1x1 pixel image, invisibly displayed on your site.
Send event using the Web SDK extension
Use an Action to configure sending XDM event data to Adobe. The Datastream receives this data, applies any configured mappings, and forwards that data to Adobe Analytics if it is an added service to that Datastream.
Log in to
Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection
using your AdobeID credentials.
Click the desired tag property.
Go to the Rules tab, then click the desired rule (or create a rule).
Under Actions, click the desired Action or click the
‘+’
icon to add an action.
Set the Extension drop-down list to
Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK
and the Action Type to
Send event
.
Send event manually implementing the Web SDK
Use the
sendEvent
command to send data to Adobe. The Datastream receives this data, applies any configured mappings, and forwards that data to Adobe Analytics if it is an added service to that Datastream.
alloy("sendEvent", {
  "xdm": {}
});
See
sendEvent
in the Web SDK documentation for more information.
Page view tracking call using the Adobe Analytics extension
The Adobe Analytics extension in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection has a dedicated location set a page view tracking call.
Log in to
Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection
using your AdobeID credentials.
Click the desired tag property.
Go to the Rules tab, then click the desired rule (or create a rule).
Under Actions, click the desired action or click the
‘+’
icon to add an action.
Set the Extension drop-down list to
Adobe Analytics
, and the Action Type to
Send Beacon
.
Click the
s.t()
radio button.
s.t() method in AppMeasurement and the Analytics extension custom code editor
Call the
s.t()
method when you want to send a tracking call to Adobe.
s.t();
Optionally, you can use an object as an argument to override variable values. See
variable overrides
for more information.
var y = new Object();
y.eVar1 = "Override value";
s.t(y);
NOTE
Previous versions of AppMeasurement used several lines of code to call this function. The additional code historically accommodated workarounds for different browsers. Standardization and best practices in modern browsers no longer require this block of code. Only the method call
s.t()
is needed now.
