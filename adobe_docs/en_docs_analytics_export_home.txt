This guide outlines ways to get data out of Adobe Analytics. It includes:
Data feeds:
Receive an hourly or daily export of raw data. Every row is an individual hit, and every column is a variable. Data feeds are typically sent to
cloud destinations
. Legacy FTP and SFTP accounts are available but are not recommended.
Data Warehouse:
Use a request wizard to retrieve a spreadsheet output of data. Data Warehouse uses a different processing architecture to allow any number of rows and any number of unique values. Data warehouse requests are typically sent to
cloud destinations
. Legacy FTP and SFTP accounts are available but are not recommended.
