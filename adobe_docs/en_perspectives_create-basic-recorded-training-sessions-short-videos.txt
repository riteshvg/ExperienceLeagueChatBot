WHAT:
Create some simple and short training videos that cover a range of basic and advanced topics, so as new users are ramping up with the tool, you aren’t delivering the same content via a meeting every time.
WHY:
This saves time for the AA Admin and takes away the dependency on one person being responsible for training others, and also allows new users to self-enable at their own pace.
HOW:
Choose the most relevant topics for your org and business users and take some time to record your bite-sized training videos. Here are some suggestions from basic to advanced topics:
How to track campaigns
How to understand page performance
How to create visualizations in Workspace
All about segments and calculated metrics
Top 5 tips in Adobe Analytics (ex: how to create drop-downs)
How to use Attribution IQ
You can then easily point users to these instead of writing lengthy emails or having yet another meeting. For more tips and tricks on training users, check out
Adobe Champion Thomas Edward Buckley’s article
all about simplifying and spending less time training users.
In addition, there is a plethora (yes, a plethora) of
video tutorials
on Adobe Experience League, as well as
free courses
. If you need a video that is specific to your company’s data and business KPIs, then by all means, record your own videos. But if a general instructional video will suffice, there’s no reason to re-invent the wheel.
