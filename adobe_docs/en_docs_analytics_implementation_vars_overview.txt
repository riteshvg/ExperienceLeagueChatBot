Analytics provides a number of variables to collect Analytics data. Variables in this section are split into several sections:
Page variables
are values that are typically used directly in reporting. Common page variables include
props
,
eVars
, and
events
.
Config variables
are settings values that help make sure the correct data reaches Adobe. Common config variables include
trackingServerSecure
,
charSet
, and
linkTrackVars
. Config variables typically do not populate dimension items.
Functions and methods
are pieces of code that perform a specific task when referenced. Common functions include
t()
,
tl()
, and
clearVars()
.
Variables and implementation methods
Adobe offers multiple ways to implement Adobe Analytics. Each page offers a section on how to implement the variable using the Web SDK, using the Adobe Analytics extension, and using AppMeasurement for JavaScript.

Order of operations
AppMeasurement libraries published by Adobe Analytics follow a specific order when sending data to Adobe. If you execute these tasks out of order, data can be incomplete.
If your site uses a data layer, make sure all applicable variables are populated first. For example, you populate
adobeDataLayer.page.title
with the page title. See
Data layer
for more information.
Use the data layer to populate Analytics variables.
If you use tags in Adobe Experience Platform, this task is accomplished by using data elements in between. Data elements are populated with values from the data layer. For example data element
Page Title
gets the value from data layer variable
adobeDataLayer.page.title
.
Then you can use the data element to populate Analytics variables. For example
eVar4
gets the value from data element
Page Title
.

, and

Finally, call the tracking function. Most AppMeasurement libraries use the
t()
method, however some mobile SDKâ€™s use
track()
. When the tracking function is called, all supported variables defined in the Analytics object are sent to Adobe in the form of an image request.
Illegal characters
The following characters and strings are never allowed in JavaScript variables.
Tab (
0x09
)
Carriage return (
0x0D
)
Newline (
0x0A
)
HTML tags (e.g.
<b></b>
or
&#153
)
Some variables have additional limitations or syntax requirements. For example, the
products
variable reserves semicolons and commas to delimit separate products and categories.
