QUESTION:
I really couldn't figure this one out on my own and I didn't find any answer on the internet neither so I'll try it here. Swagger is showing me lots of controllers that I have not created and I have no idea where they come from. They are clogging up my api documentation and I would really like to get rid of all of them and only keep the API routes I explicitly declared. They are all called either name-controller, name-entity-controller or name-search-controller, with name being the name of an entity. Here is an example of controllers I want to get rid of in the swagger ui.
